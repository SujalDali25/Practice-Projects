Overview
Predicting the price of gold can be valuable for investors, policymakers, and financial institutions. This project uses Linear Regression to analyze and forecast the price of gold using historical data from multiple countries.

Data
The dataset contains monthly gold prices from 10 different countries over the past 40 years. It includes the following columns:

date: The date of the observation (end of the month)
country: The country for which the price is recorded
price: The price of gold (in the local currency of the country)

Dependencies
Python 3.6+
pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
matplotlib
seaborn

Model
The model employs Linear Regression to predict future gold prices. Key steps involved include:

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, feature engineering, and data normalization.
Model Training: Using training data to develop the Linear Regression model.
Model Evaluation: Assessing the model's performance using metrics like RMSE and R² Score.
Prediction: Forecasting future gold prices based on the trained model.
Results
The results section will contain:

Performance metrics (e.g., RMSE, R² Score)
Visualizations of actual vs. predicted prices
Forecasted gold prices for the next months/years
